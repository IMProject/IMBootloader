IMBootloader is a universal bootloader for embedded devices.

Idea is to save developers time for writing bootloader and flasher applications.
This bootloader works together with the flasher app [IMFlasher](https://github.com/IMProject/IMFlasher).

In the future, we will add as many as possible microcontrollers.
