### About
IMBootloader is a universal bootloader for embedded devices.

Idea is to save developers time for writing bootloader and flasher applications.
This bootloader works together with the flasher app [IMFlasher](https://github.com/IMProject/IMFlasher).

#### Application example
Each MCU has it's own [IMLedBlik](https://github.com/IMProject/IMLedBlink) example. It is a good starting point for developing an application or to get an idea of how to jump from the application to IMBootloader.

#### Currently supprted MCUs:

* STM32L4xx
* STM32H7xx

#### Currently supprted boards:

| Board                                                                | MCU      |
